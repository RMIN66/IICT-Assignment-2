HTML and CSS Assignment

EcoDrone is a fictional beginner-level concept about using small, eco-friendly drones for basic tasks.
I chose this idea because it is simple, modern, and easy to design using HTML and CSS.

Green color theme to show nature and eco-friendliness

Grid layout for the page structure

Flexbox for the feature boxes

Simple form with checkboxes, radio buttons, and a dropdown

Basic hover effects to add CSS-only interactivity

Responsive design so the layout changes on wider screens
